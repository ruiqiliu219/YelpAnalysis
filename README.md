#Mapping Minneapolis Restaurants – Does Yelp rating vary by location?

##Introduction
This project investigates the correlation between location and Yelp’s rating. I first show that a restaurant’s rating is correlated with its location, controlling for price and business category effects. Using one way analysis of variance method and ordinal logistic regression framework, I find that rating varies with location – Downtown, Calhoun-Isles, Marcy Holmes - Northeast South and University area perform significant worse than other. Next, I examine the relationship between business popularity, Yelp’s rating and its location. I use the amount of reviews one restaurant received as a proxy for popularity and find that low rated restaurants can still be popular as long as it falls in a big business cluster.
